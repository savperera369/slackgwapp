                Mr. W. M. Senevirathne was the first Consul General for Sri Lanka in Toronto. 
                My family had a very good relationship with his family and we used to meet very often. It was December 2002. 
                He called me to inform that he will be leaving Canada soon because his term here is ending and indicated that he wanted to meet me. When we met, while discussing other matters, he reminded a request he had made earlier. 
                He said he was very keen to see the establishment of a Sri Lankan association in the Kitchener Waterloo area.I agreed to go all out and do my best to fulfill his request.

                From that day I started planning the initial meeting. 
                In any society, we see people grouping together for various reasons such as similar interests, religion, relationships, professions etc.
                I realized that my biggest challenge was to reach these various groups. My instinct directed me to contact Professor Rohan Jayasundara of the Waterloo University. 
                He had been in the community for a long time and was well respected by everyone in the community. I realized that I will be able to make inroads into many of the groups in the Sri Lankan community, If I was able to get his cooperation.

                My first meeting with Rohan was a success. 
                He agreed to join be as an organizer of a Sri Lankan association. 
                We decided that we should include Sri Lankans living in Cambridge and Guelph into any organization that we will form. 
                He suggested that we invite Dodangoda Gunasekera to join us as an organizer. Dodangoda Gunasekera has been a resident of Guelph for a long time. He was also respected as a leader in that community. Rohan also felt that Dodangoda will be able to contact the Sri Lankans in Cambridge area. 
                Dodangoda willingly accepted our invitation and expressed his willingness to support us.

                By this time, we were well into February 2003. 
                I had to find a suitable venue and a date. 
                I failed in my attempt to get a place free of charge. 
                After researching various locations I selected the Country Hills Community Centre at Rittenhouse Road Kitchener as the suitable venue. It has plenty of free parking and all other facilities including a Kitchen. It was also easily accessible from all cities. 
                We had no funds coming from anywhere. Three of us who took the responsibility of organizing had to advance funds. I paid for the hall. Other two looked after the other expenses.

                I contacted Mr. Senevirathne, Consul General and informed him that we were ready to hold the initial meeting. 
                I requested him to contact, Ms. Geetha de Silva, High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Ottawa - Canada on our behalf and to give us a suitable date for the meeting in early April 2003. 
                I sent two invitations direct to the High Commissioner and the Consul General. 
                Both accepted our invitation and gave us April 05, 2003, 6.15 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. as the suitable date and time.

                All three of us, Rohan, Dodangoda and I started making calls and inviting Sri Lankans for the meeting.
                I went to the extent of going through the telephone directory and calling people who I recognized as having Sri Lankan names. 
                We agreed to include Deepananda Herath from Guelph also as an organizer, on the recommendation of Dodangoda. 
                We planned a pot luck dinner as well. Interest and the support from our community was very encouraging. We received many offers to bring items of food for the pot luck. 
                As organizers, we were delighted.

                Weather man gave us bad news. He predicted a snow storm for April 5th. 
                I called the High Commissioner. She informed me that she will be attending the meeting without fail and was not concerned about the weather predictions.

                April 05, 2003 came. By 6.30 p.m. we had over 60 Sri Lankans in attendance. 
                Venerable B. Devamitta who was the Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka residing at the Laos Buddhist temple in Kitchener was present to bless us.High Commissioner, Ms. Geetha de Silva and the Consul General, Mr. W. M. Senavirathne arrived ahead of time. 
                The very first meeting of the Sri Lankan community in Cambridge, Guelph, Kitchener and Waterloo started at 6.30 p.m. Looking at the audience, we felt great to see the enthusiasm in the faces of those in attendance. 
                After all the speeches and discussions, we decided to form an Association to organize future activities. A Committee was elected. (Three of the elected members did not attend a single meeting. Active Committee Members filled the three vacancies by inviting three other persons.)

                Once the meeting adjourned, those present got the opportunity to mingle and get to know those whom they had not met before. 
                They renewed their friendships and made new friendships. There was lot of food for the potluck. 
                After enjoying the food, we dispersed, happy about what we achieved and hoping that the seed we planted will grow up to be a healthy, huge tree, big enough to provide shelter and a meeting place for the Sri Lankan community in Cambridge, Guelph, Kitchener and Waterloo.
